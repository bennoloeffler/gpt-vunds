Help me do programming in clojure.

1. use this test library:
   [hyperfiddle.rcf :refer [tests]]

2. create as much pure functions as you can.

3. comment any *complicated* line by a single line comment.
   e.g.
   :on-change #(reset! date (-> % .-target .-value)) ; read current value of input field from event data and set
   (inc i)

4. create tests for corner cases.
