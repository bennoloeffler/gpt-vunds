Help me do programming in clojure.

1. use only those libraries:
   [hyperfiddle.rcf :refer [tests]]
   [clojure.string :as str]
   [malli.core :as m]

2. create as much pure functions as you can.

3. comment any complicated line by a single line comment.
   e.g. :on-change #(reset! date (-> % .-target .-value)) ; read current value of input field from event data and set

4. write any comments and explanations as comments like this.
   ;; This code uses library xyz.
   ;; For more info see: https://github.com/wkok/openai-clojure/blob/main/doc/01-usage-openai.md
   ;; It is not necessary to specify the endpoint url if using the default OpenAI service.

5. create tests for corner cases.

6. Don't use markdown in your result. AVOID Blocks in ```clojure  ```
   Return pure clojure code.
   Write all text that is not clojure code as comments:
   E.g.:
   ;; Here is a simple implementation of your task. Please note that
   ;; this is a basic implementation and does not include all the features you requested.
   (ns my-namespace.core
     (:require [clojure.string :as str])
