                                2. Grace Hopper: Known for her work on the concept of machine-independent programming languages, Hopper developed the first compiler and helped popularize high-level programming languages like COBOL.

                                3. Bill Gates: Co-founder of Microsoft, Gates played a pivotal role in the personal computer revolution. His leadership and entrepreneurship contributed to the development of MS-DOS and the widespread adoption of Windows operating system.

                                4. Tim Berners-Lee: Credited with inventing the World Wide Web, Berners-Lee developed the HTTP and HTML protocols, revolutionizing information sharing and enabling the global network of interconnected documents we use today.

                                5. John McCarthy: McCarthy coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" (AI) and made significant contributions in the field. He developed the Lisp programming language, which became influential in AI research, and his ideas helped shape the field's foundations."}

 === Example Input 1: ===

Produktionsprozesse mÃ¼ssen heute als Gesamtprozess betrachtet und Remanufacturing- bzw. Recycling-Prozesse von Anfang an bereits in den frÃ¼hen Phasen der Produktentwicklung mitgedacht werden, damit wertvolle Rohstoffe auch zukÃ¼nftig fÃ¼r produzierende Unternehmen verfÃ¼gbar bleiben. Recycling- bzw. Remanufacturing-Prozesse mÃ¼ssen zur WertschÃ¶pfung im Unternehmen beitragen. Insbesondere in den Branchen Maschinenbau und Industrial Automation wird dies zu einem wichtigen Wettbewerbsvorteil werden. In unserer Veranstaltung Â»WertschÃ¶pfung durch WiederverwendungÂ« diskutieren wir mit namhaften Vertretern aus Wirtschaft und Forschung darÃ¼ber, wie Produktion als Gesamtprozess betrachtet werden kann. Ein Prozess, der von der intelligenten Planung und lÃ¼ckenlosen Dokumentation Ã¼ber den gesamten Lebenszyklus eines Produktes bis hin zum Remanufacturing bzw. Recycling bis auf die Rohstoffebene des Produktes reicht.\n \nWir freuen uns auf Ihre Teilnahme.\n \nMit freundlichen GrÃ¼ÃŸen\n \nDipl.-Wirtsch.-Ing.

   Search for those fields for a person:
     full name
     position and / or position
     email
     mobil
     phone

   Search for those fields for a company:

2. if there are only parts of the requested fields available, provide those, eg:
   person:
     email
     mobile
3. separate the fields, if neccesary. E.g. if street, postal code and city are in the same line:
   - separate street and number from postal code and city in different lines.
4. provide all persons found, every information found line by line.
5. provide the company data line by line.
6. search for
    - the approximate, roughly estimated number of employees and

  1. Create a hiccup text field that lets the user input dates and validates the input.
  2. Use :on-change to update a local atom
  3. write a validation function to check for ISO date format.
  4. If :on-change got an Enter-key pressed event or :on-blur was called, start validating at every key press.
  5. Use :on-blur call a callback function, given to the component, if successfully validated.
  6. if clicking the calendar-icon on the left side of the input-field, open a date-picker.

Help me do programming in clojure.

1. use only those libraries:
   [hyperfiddle.rcf :refer [tests]]
   [clojure.string :as str]
   [malli.core :as m]

2. create as much pure functions as you can.

3. comment any complicated line by a single line comment.
   e.g. :on-change #(reset! date (-> % .-target .-value)) ; read current value of input field from event data and set

4. write any comments and explanations as comments like this.
   ;; This code uses library xyz.
   ;; For more info see: https://github.com/wkok/openai-clojure/blob/main/doc/01-usage-openai.md
   ;; It is not necessary to specify the endpoint url if using the default OpenAI service.

5. create tests for corner cases.

6. Don't use markdown in your result. AVOID Blocks in ```clojure  ```
   Return pure clojure code.
   Write all text that is not clojure code as comments:
   E.g.:
   ;; Here is a simple implementation of your task. Please note that
   ;; this is a basic implementation and does not include all the features you requested.
   (ns my-namespace.core
     (:require [clojure.string :as str])
